# Listings

This is a fork of the [WP Job Manager plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/WP-Job-Manager) that is designed to provide a more generic listings solution.
 
Todo:
* Extract the jobs specific functionality into a separate plugin
* Rewrite the CSS and HTML to `listings` classes
* Change variable names and meta fields
* Probably a lot more, it's a fun project :)
