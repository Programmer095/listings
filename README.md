# Listings

Listings is built on the solid foundation of the [WP Job Manager plugin](https://github.com/Automattic/WP-Job-Manager). We decided to fork this project to provide a more generic listings plugin that could be easily extended for more specific use-cases.

## Download

Listings is available for free over on the [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/listings/) plugin repository.

## Extensions

We decided to keep our core listings plugin quite lean and the real potential for more specific needs comes with our extensions. Here is the current list of available extensions for Listings available for free on WordPress.org:

- [Jobs on WP.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/listings-jobs/)[Jobs on GitHub](https://github.com/wplistings/listings-jobs/)

## Addons

We're currently working on a handful of useful addons which will be compatibile with core Listings and extensions.

## Documentation

All Listings Documenation can be found here: http://docs.wplistings.com/
